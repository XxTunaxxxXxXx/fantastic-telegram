Test project

Unable to find an existing list matching carOrdinal to each unique car. So set up this project to test things and start building a catalogue json file.

Script sets up a quick server to listen for incoming udp info from Forza Horizon 5, and has a background thread constantly updating a carOrdinal variable.
Simple terminal prompt entrys to save ordinal, skip car, or save file and quit. 

The csv sheet and csv_to_json.py not needed at this point, but left for cataloging reasons or the very rare case someone else stumbles upon it searching for examples.
