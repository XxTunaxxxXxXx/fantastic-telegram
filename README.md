Test project

Unable to find an existing list matching carOrdinal to each unique car. So set up this project to test things and start building a catalogue json file.

forzatelemtry.py is a telemtry server class that will recieve data from Forza Horizon 5 and have it available for output
main.py is a GUI window that requires PYQT5, as an easy means to update carOrdinals
terminalversion.py is the original version I made just through terminal, but essentially has the same functionality as the gui one. 

The original csv sheet and csv_to_json.py not needed at this point, but left for cataloging reasons or the very rare case someone else stumbles upon it searching for examples of such things.
